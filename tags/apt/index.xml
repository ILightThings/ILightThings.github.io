The easiest way I have found is reading papers on https://samples.vx-underground.org/APTs where a number of articles are consolidated and collected in PDF format.
A group I see time and time again is APT41 which is speculated to be a CN hacker group. They go by a number of aliases, which I won&amp;rsquo;t go into but I watch there attack patterns that are very similar to those taught in the OSEP.</description></item></channel></rss>
